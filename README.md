# Cloud Foundry Node.js Buildpack with OpenJDK 7

This buildpack is a fork of the [Cloud Foundry Node.js Buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack), but adds the [OpenJDK 7 JDK](http://openjdk.java.net/) (includes the JRE) ubuntu package during the supply phase.
This is particularly useful for project using the [java module for nodejs](https://github.com/joeferner/node-java) (and all modules which depend on node-java).
